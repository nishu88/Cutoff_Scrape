11/08/18, 11:22 pm - +91 97313 90425: How come this is being allowed?
11/08/18, 11:25 pm - +91 98842 92434: Internship doesn't guarantee job. It's more than fair to give them FTE opportunities.
11/08/18, 11:25 pm - +91 98842 92434: But idk. Wait for SPCs to reply xD
11/08/18, 11:25 pm - Deekshit New: +1

11/08/18, 11:30 pm - +91 94820 17077: But on a pragmatic note, most companies' internship offers from RVCE get converted to FTEs with a probibility close to 100% , just saying 😅
11/08/18, 11:30 pm - +91 94820 17077: Probability**
11/08/18, 11:32 pm - Deekshit New: Probability is not 100%

11/08/18, 11:34 pm - +91 94820 17077: Okay
11/08/18, 11:53 pm - +91 81054 34752: We understand your concern. It's 40 lakhs. Nobody wants to miss on such an opportunity. We tried our best and asked sir if people with open dream offers can take the test. Sir spoke to the Principal but he didn't allow it, so the only thing left was to ask about people who have only Internships. 
If you still feel it's unfair, you can write a mail.

12/08/18, 12:25 am - Madavan Aditya Rv: Fun fact - Texas Instruments internship to FTE conversion rate is 60%
2. In any internship offer people don't have a guarantee that they'll get the job for sure.
3. Open dream FTE, you do have something confirmed 100%
4. People who have dream and others with internships only, who don't have any guarantee (in writing from the company) should be eligible for jobs that give them some closure.
5. If you already have an open dream offer (FTE), you have closure. You have a job that pays well. The others don't.

I think it's that simple.
